# Creation of physical booth

## First sketch

### Dimensions
- Width: 100 cm
- Depth: 150 cm
- Height: 200 cm

### Description

The booth was designed to be big enough to fit a person and have some space for movement. The height was chosen to be 200 cm to ensure that most people can stand comfortably inside the booth. 

The booth will be made of wood and have walls on three sides. The side will be open with a curtain for easy access. The front of the booth can be decorated with posters and information about the project. The inside of the back wall will have a camera at eye level (120 cm from the ground) and a screen above it to display the user's photo. On the back side of the booth there will be a small box to hold the electronics and cables. The three walls will be held together will a cut in lid on the top. This will make it easy to assemble and disassemble the booth.

## Revision 

### Dimensions

After measuring the chosen lengths of wood, it became clear the booth was bigger than necessary. The bigger length also made it harder to transport the booth. Therefore, the dimensions were changed to the following:

- Width: 75 cm
- Depth: 110 cm

The height remained the same at 200 cm.

### Back wall

The idea for the back wall was changed as well. Instead of having the camera at eye level, I decided to place it higher up and have the screen at this level instead. This way, the user can look at the screen while taking a photo, making it easier to pose. The eye level was also changed from 120 cm to 90 cm.

The box for the electronics was also changed. Instead of having a box on the back side of the booth, it was scrapped entirely. The electronics will be placed on a small table behind the booth instead. This eliminates the need for a box, thus making the booth easier to create and transport.

## Building the booth

The booth was built using wooden lats for the framing and 4mm MDF boards for the walls. The wooden lats were cut to size using a saw and then assembled using screws. The entire booth was built using 2 sheets of 122x244 cm MDF board. The first sheet was cut to fit the side wall which is 110x200 cm. The second sheet was used to create the front wall which is 75x200 cm. With the remaining pieces, the back wall was created which is 75x200 cm as well.

### Back wall construction

The most imporant part of the booth is the back wall, which holds the camera and screen. So I decided to build this part first. The outside framing is the same for both the front and back wall. So I used the front panel to measure and cut the framing for the back wall. The horizontal lats were screwed on top of the vertical ones. The MDF board is placed on the vertical lats, leaving a small gap at the bottom and top. This space is filled up with another row of horizontal lats. This way, the MDF board can be screwed on all four sides.

After deattaching the front panel, I cut the two leftover pieces of MDF board (from the 244 to 200cm cut) to the correct width of 75 cm. These pieces were then screwed onto the framing to start the back wall.

_Later I will find out about the sticker still being on the MDF board._

Then I decided to add the framing for both the monitor and camera as shown in the sketch. I made sure to measure the correct dimensions of the monitor and regularly check if the framing fit. 

The framing is set to be a bit more inward than the MDF board. This way, the monitor can rest against the MDF board and not fall through the hole. The same thing goes for the camera.

After the framing was done, I added some panels to the wall. The panels are made of leftover MDF board pieces. I cut them to size and screwed them onto the framing.

The camera hole is 4 cm in diameter, which is big enough to fit the camera. It also has 1 cm of space on all sides around it.

Heres a picture of the back wall with the monitor fitted in. It can be placed in from the back and rests on the lats and against the MDF board. Currently it can still fall out the back.

To prevent this, I added two small lats at the top monitor lat and screw it in using 1 screw on each lat. These lats can be rotated upwards to easily take the monitor out again.

### Product demo

We used this wall to demonstrate the product at our school in Amsterdam. The booth was placed in front of a table with the laptop and other electronics on the side.

### Side wall

Though the side wall has already shrunk in size from the first sketch, it still is quite big and hard to transport. So I decided to make the side wall in two pieces that can be put together using a hinge. This way, the side wall can be folded in half and is easier to transport. The side wall is made using the same method as the back wall. The framing is made using wooden lats and the MDF board is screwed onto the framing.

I filed out the MDF board where the hinge is placed. This way, there is less of a gap when the wall is folded out.

After attaching the second panel the side wall was done.

### Front wall

The front wall was made using the same method as the back wall. After the previous walls, this one was quite easy to make.

### Assembling the booth

After thinking about the assembly of the booth, I wanted to get started on the lid. But then the issue of light came up. The booth needs to be bright enough for the camera to take good pictures. So I decided to scrap the lid idea and make the booth open at the top. This way, there is enough light coming in from above. The walls can still be held together using corner braces.

The back wall of the booth is still in Amsterdam, so I could only assemble the side and front wall. The side wall is attached to the front wall using corner braces on the top and bottom.
