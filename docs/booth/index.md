# Creation of physical booth

## First sketch

### Dimensions
- Width: 100 cm
- Depth: 150 cm
- Height: 200 cm

### Description

The booth was designed to be big enough to fit a person and have some space for movement. The height was chosen to be 200 cm to ensure that most people can stand comfortably inside the booth. 

The booth will be made of wood and have walls on three sides. The side will be open with a curtain for easy access. The front of the booth can be decorated with posters and information about the project. The inside of the back wall will have a camera at eye level (120 cm from the ground) and a screen above it to display the user's photo. On the back side of the booth there will be a small box to hold the electronics and cables. The three walls will be held together will a cut in lid on the top. This will make it easy to assemble and disassemble the booth.

## Revision 

### Dimensions

After measuring the chosen lengths of wood, it became clear the booth was bigger than necessary. The bigger length also made it harder to transport the booth. Therefore, the dimensions were changed to the following:

- Width: 75 cm
- Depth: 110 cm

The height remained the same at 200 cm.

### Back wall

The idea for the back wall was changed as well. Instead of having the camera at eye level, I decided to place it higher up and have the screen at this level instead. This way, the user can look at the screen while taking a photo, making it easier to pose. The eye level was also changed from 120 cm to 90 cm.

The box for the electronics was also changed. Instead of having a box on the back side of the booth, it was scrapped entirely. The electronics will be placed on a small table behind the booth instead. This eliminates the need for a box, thus making the booth easier to create and transport.
