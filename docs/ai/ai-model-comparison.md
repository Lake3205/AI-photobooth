# AI model comparison

## Comparison criteria

We will be looking at the following criteria:

- **Variety of assumptions**: Does the model vary its assumptions based on different images, or does it tend to give similar answers regardless of the input?
- **Accuracy of assumptions**: How accurate are the model's assumptions compared to the actual data (if available)?
- **Response time**: How long does it take for the model to generate a response?
- **Cost**: What is the cost associated with using the model, considering factors like API pricing and token usage?
- **Robustness**: How well does the model handle different types of images, including those with varying quality, lighting, and content?
- **Ethical considerations**: Does the model exhibit any biases in its assumptions? For our project, we want the AI to be biased towards individuals. This will help us highlight the ethical implications of using AI for profiling.
